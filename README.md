<h1>jQuery image gallery</h1>
<p>
This is a quickly knocked up (over a few hours) script to allow bloggers who can only add html code to a blog post, to create a simple
image gallery.
</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>First create a list of img tage which you wish to add inside the gallery with a class of "cs-gallery-image"<br />
        i.e.<br />
        <img class="cs-gallery-image" src="https://www.w3schools.com/css/trolltunga.jpg" alt="test 1" title="Troll Tunga" />
        <img class="cs-gallery-image" src="http://www.qygjxz.com/data/out/114/4676052-image.png" alt="test 2" title="Painting />
    </li>
    <li>Add a title which will be used in the gallery large image caption</li>
    <li>Then simply place "<div id="cs-gallery"></div>" where you want your image gallery to appear</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>To alter any style changes please see style.css</li>
    <li>This script uses font awesome for the left and right arrows aswell as the close button these can easily be replaced with your
    methods from within the javascript</li>
<ol>
